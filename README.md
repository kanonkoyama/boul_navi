## Features

There are sites that introduce bouldering gym experience plans, etc., but there are not many bouldering gym sites that mainly rely on word of mouth. I thought it would be interesting if I actually went there and introduced it, so I created it.

## Requirement

* Express 4.18.2
* node.js 16.18.0
* MySQL 8.0.33
* bcrypt 5.1.0
* dotenv 16.3.1

## Note

From this site, I would like to improve it so that you can make a reservation for a gym experience.
